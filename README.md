## The Computer

That total build for the computer is $3000. the CPU, GPU, and Motherboard are the most expensive things. 




If the parts list doesnt show up that is okay! I've linked every part.

If you somehow want the buy the whole computer, I'll pull up the whole build in Micro Center so that you can save some money.

I know it is expenisve but this is what I was thinking about getting. If you can't get the whole computer, I would love it if you could buy the most expensive parts like the [GPU](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-RTX-4080-16GB/dp/B0BL668N1X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3NV32WN620Z90&keywords=NVIDIA+GeForce+RTX+4080+msi&qid=1670317554&sprefix=nvidia+geforce+rtx+4080+msi%2Caps%2C71&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.17f26c18-b61b-4ce9-8a28-de351f41cffb), [CPU](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-7900X-24-Thread-Unlocked-Processor/dp/B0BBJ59WJ4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3QRKV5UHC6RQZ&keywords=AMD+Ryzen+9+7900X&qid=1670317584&sprefix=amd+ryzen+9+7900x%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-1-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.c3015c4a-46bb-44b9-81a4-dc28e6d374b3&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFBQlM3TzFQNjBaNFUmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0MDczMTcyVFdQWVFJT1YyUjlBJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5Njk3ODhERjJCRzc5MlFSRTImd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl), and [motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-X670E-Motherboard-Front-Panel/dp/B0BDTN8SNJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23MVUW89PSCEG&keywords=ASUS+X670E+ROG+Crosshair+Hero&qid=1670316863&sprefix=asus+x670e+rog+crosshair+hero%2Caps%2C82&sr=8-1). There is also a combo for the [CPU, Motherboard, and RAM](https://www.microcenter.com/product/5006074/AMD_Ryzen_9_7900X,_ASUS_X670E_ROG_Crosshair_Hero,_GSkill_Flare_X5_Series_32GB_DDR5-6000_Kit,_Computer_Build_Combo).

If you bought the list of things through Micro Center, it would be much cheaper but you would have to pick up the parts from the store in St. Louis or KC becasue we dont have a Micro Center in Columbia. I would also accept a gift card from them as well!

## Games 

Besides the computer, I would love the new [Pokemon](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pokemon-Violet-Video-Region/dp/B0B2X4BMV2/ref=pd_lpo_3?pd_rd_w=yXde3&content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_r=CD00EY6VNCQQ97RY3ZR4&pd_rd_wg=vRzyG&pd_rd_r=aa11feb2-8650-42e3-b2ed-854371e536c3&pd_rd_i=B0B2X4BMV2&psc=1) Game!

## Shoes 

I was also thinking about getting some new [Jordan 1's](https://www.goat.com/sneakers/air-jordan-1-low-shadow-toe-553558-052?utm_source=Google_Ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=16777436806&utm_content=&utm_term=&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7bucBhCeARIsAIOwr-8ZPN7LWrWWaNIg2uNiCkAEWz9O3TK1yRuh0JLZ3OuLsXkeaTVouxIaAtjGEALw_wcB) in size 10.5.
